The next most usefule thing we could do is get input from a real USB keyboard.  In order to do this, we first must set up exceptions and interrupts.  If you are

If you want to download the code for this part and play with it for yourself, [see my git
repo](https://github.com/jsandler18/raspi-kernel/tree/c7abe6f5ed05c9ed8c44e6a7f30982fdc3a47676)
